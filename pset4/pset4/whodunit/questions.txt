1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to
allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, 
together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.

2.  It helps us avoid to using unnecessary bytes. Also we can define variables that cannot be lesser than 0 with unsigned(for ex: uint8_t)
specifier, so it helps us to avoid wrong signed variables.

3.  BYTE > 1, DWORD > 4, LONG > 4, WORD 2

4.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the character "M" in ASCII encoding.

5.  bfSize is The size of the bitmap file in bytes
    biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure in bitmapinfoheader structure
    
6.  The bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  biBitCount

8.  File format might not be a bitmap file.

9.  Because it should read the file one pixel by one pixel.

10. 3

11. fseek allows us to change the location of the file position indicator. If there is padding, it changes the location of the file 
position indicator by adding padding size.

12. current location of the file position indicator
